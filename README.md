irvine-01-sw software repository development tree

The irvine-01-sw project is the main entry point for irvine cubesat development

Development Machine OS
The irvine-01-sw project should work on any modern Linux distribution, 64-bit or 32-bit. You may install Ubuntu on a new/repurposed PC or in a virtual guest in VirtualBox. The Ubuntu 14.04 ISO image may be downloaded from the Ubuntu website

Ubuntu packages
To build irvine-01-sw, make sure you have git,cmake and the GNU C compiler installed:

sudo apt-get install git cmake gcc g++ cmake
Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit) Notes
For cross compiling to work, install the 32-bit compatibility libraries:

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386
Getting the irvine-01-sw project
To get started, retrieve the main software project and install the arm toolchain.

git clone https://github.com/irvinecubesat/irvine-01-sw
cd irvine-01-sw
For the latest development code use the dev branch:

git checkout dev
Setup access to CubeSatNet
CubeSatNet is a virtual private network that will give you access to Irvine CubeSat boards remotely so that you can familiarize yourself with the embedded hardware and test your software.

Inside the irvine-01-sw project, type:

make genKeys
This will prompt you for a password which you will use for CubeSatNet VPN access. After entering your password and confirmation password, create a Jira issue in teh ICS project and attach the xxx-cubesatSetupRequest.txt.enc file to the issue.

Once your account is set up, you will be able to connect to CubeSatNet using the vpnConnect.sh script.

Building irvine-01-sw
The irvine-01-sw utilizes CMake to build the software. You can build the software for your host machine to test it, then cross compile it for the arm architecture in order to run it on the board.

make all-arm
This will build the arm binaries and put them under the build-arm directory.

You can type make all to build x86 binaries under the build directory.

The first time you run the all or all-arm build, it will download and install the toolchain.

The irvine-01-cfg Project
The irvine-01-cfg github project has files that replace or modifies the image generated by buildroot. You use this project to customize the image.

To retrieve the irvine-01-cfg project:

git clone https://github.com/irvinecubesat/irvine-01-cfg
The BuildRoot Project
The BuildRoot environment builds the image to upload to the cubesat board. The buildroot environment is set up to build the irvine-01-sw sources and install the irvine-01-cfg files into the fsw_image.

If you haven't already, setup access to CubeSatNet first as described above.

Once the admin has updated the configuration with your certificate, type the following the irvine-01-sw project to allow you to successfuly build the buildroot project:

git pull
make authfile
Note: You can do all your programming in the irvine-01-sw project without building the buildroot project, which builds the image to upload to the cubesat.

Make sure you have the necessary packages installed on your system:

 sudo apt-get install git bison g++ flex gettext texinfo libncurses5-dev
64-bit Ubuntu should also install the 32-bit libraries:

sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0
Note: The above instructions did not work for me on 64bit Kubuntu 16.10. If you run into errors about apt-get being unable to locate the packages, follow these instructions instead

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libz1:i386 libncurses5:i386 libbz2-1.0:i386

Clone the irvinecubesat buildroot project from github:

git clone https://github.com/irvinecubesat/buildroot


Then make it:

cd buildroot make

This will take a long time, and the end result will be under output/images

## Examining the image
The image will end up in the directory `buildroot/output/images/fsw_image`.
You can examine the directory structure of the image by looking at the
`fsw_image.rootfs.cpio` file:

Inside the buildroot/output/images/fsw_image directory, type:
mkdir tmp cd tmp cpio -i < ../fsw_image.rootfs.cpio

The cpio command will extract the rootfs into the tmp directory where you
can take a look at what is in the image.

*Note:  Do not follow the CalPoly buildroot instructions*

Use the above BuildRoot instructions instead.
